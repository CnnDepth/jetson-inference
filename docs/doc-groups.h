 * @defgroup deepVision Deep Vision Primitives
 * C/C++ runtime APIs for supporting deep vision network model primitives and inferencing with TensorRT.
 * Available network primitives currently include:  
 *   - \ref imageNet for image recognition
 *   - \ref detectNet for object detection + localization
 *   - \ref segNet for segmentation
 *
 * The different primitives each inherit from the shared \ref tensorNet object.
